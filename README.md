# Slot Machine Game - README

## Overview
This is a simple terminal-based slot machine game written in Python. Players can deposit money, choose the number of lines to bet on, and place bets for each line. The game simulates the spinning of a slot machine with three rows and three columns, using randomly selected symbols. Players can win based on matching symbols across the lines they bet on, and the payout is determined by the symbol values.

## Features
- Deposit funds to play the game.
- Place bets on up to 3 lines.
- Simulate a slot machine spin with symbols that have different values.
- Calculate winnings based on the symbol and the amount bet.
- Display the current balance after each spin.
- The game continues until the player decides to quit or runs out of balance.

## Symbols and Their Values
The game uses four symbols with varying frequencies and payouts:
- **Symbol A**: Appears 2 times, Payout = 5x the bet.
- **Symbol B**: Appears 4 times, Payout = 4x the bet.
- **Symbol C**: Appears 6 times, Payout = 2x the bet.
- **Symbol D**: Appears 8 times, Payout = 3x the bet.

## Project Structure
- **`symbol_count`**: Defines how frequently each symbol appears in the slot machine spin.
- **`symbol_value`**: Defines the payout values for each symbol.
- **Functions**:
  - `deposit()`: Prompts the player to deposit money into the game.
  - `get_number_of_lines()`: Asks the player how many lines they want to bet on.
  - `get_bet()`: Prompts the player to place a bet on each line.
  - `get_slot_machine_spin()`: Simulates the slot machine spin by randomly selecting symbols for each column.
  - `print_slot_machine()`: Displays the slot machine's current state after a spin.
  - `check_winnings()`: Checks if the player has won on any of the lines they bet on and calculates the total winnings.
  - `game()`: Manages a single round of the game, including betting, spinning the slot machine, and updating the balance.
  - `main()`: The entry point of the game that manages the playerâ€™s balance and handles multiple rounds.

## How to Play

6. **Continue or Quit**: After each round, you can either continue playing or quit the game.
